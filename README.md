## A RISC Microcontroller description

This repository contains the description, in VHDL, of a microcontroller that uses RISC philosophy and Harvard Architecture, as well as the documentation with the structure of the Datapath, the control unit and its Instruction Set Architecture. In order to expose the entire process of its design and implementation, the .vhd codes as well as simulation and synthesis files can also be found.
